    Jos√© Ribeiro is an Adjunct Professor and a Researcher at the Department of Computer Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, Portugal.
    His research focuses on Software Testing and Evolutionary Algorithms, but he is also strongly passionate about Context-Aware Systems and Cognitive Computing.
</p>

<p>
    In this Workshop you will be introduced to Google‚Äôs Vision APIs -- ML Kit, Cloud Vision, and AutoML Vision -- and learn
    how to leverage the potential of these Cognitive Computing tools to develop more engaging, personalized, and helpful Android apps.

<p>
    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/" target="_blank"> ML Kit</a> comes with a set of ready-to-use APIs for common mobile use cases: recognizing text, detecting faces,
    identifying landmarks, scanning barcodes, and labeling images. ML Kit‚Äôs on-device APIs can process your data quickly
    and work even when there‚Äôs no network connection.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/" target="_blank"> Cloud Vision API</a> enables developers to understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine
    learning models in an easy-to-use API. It uses the power of Google Cloud Platform's machine learning technology to
    give you an even higher level of accuracy, and quickly classifies images into thousands of categories, detects individual
    objects and faces within images, and reads printed words contained within images.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/" target="_blank"> AutoML Vision</a> makes it possible for developers with limited machine learning expertise to
    train high-quality custom models. After uploading and labeling images, AutoML Vision will train
    a model that can scale as needed to adapt to demands. AutoML Vision offers higher model accuracy
    and faster time to create a production-ready model.
